# y2mate-Downloader

Simple downloader that makes the tedious process of downloading a youtube video just 
2-3 clicks (most of the times)

uses y2mate.com for downloading videos.

I made this because the official y2mate extention is very sus

## Usage

Right Click on any youtube link or video to bring up the context menu and choose download options


### youtube.com / youtube iframe

## Known Issues

The video download options contains pre-defined video qualities which may or may not be available to download from y2mate.

This is rare since the options contain the most popular formats but HD and FHD sometimes don't appear in the downloads section for y2mate.

Might fix if it bothers too much
